# COMP0034 Coursework 1 template repository

To set up your project:

1. Clone this repository in your IDE (e.g. PyCharm, Visual Studio Code) from GitHub. Follow the help in your IDE
   e.g. [clone a GitHub repo in PyCharm.](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/manage-projects-hosted-on-github.html#clone-from-GitHub)
2. Create and then activate a virtual environment (venv). Use the instructions for your IDE
   or [navigate to your project directory and use python.](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/)
3. Install the requirements from requirements.txt. Use the instructions for your IDE
   or [the pip documentation](https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/user_guide/#requirements-files).
4. Edit .gitignore to add any config files and folders for your IDE.

# Dash app

The app works as intended for the most part by delivering the appropriate information to the users.
The app is designed to be multi pages for organisation and for each team, however this was not done
as the time constraints would not allow for me to create such a large app. The app also lacks in
terms of information being displayed, but this was again due to the time constraints as there would
be a need for at least 5 or 6 more graphs to illustrate all the intended information. The app
currently displays information on only the home side of the football field and does not fully
encapsulate everything, such as away field and total performances.

To combat the issue of lack of information, the framework for other data sets to create graphs are in place ready to be
dispatched. The data frames previously cleaned are ready and graphs for the away side can be implemented using similar
methods to the homes side. Since the app is not multipage, some elements that would otherwise be in other pages are on
the visualisation page but can be easily implemented into other pages.
